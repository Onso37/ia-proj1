# Fanorona 
> A board game originated from Madagascar
### Before playing
You need to install memory profiler to run utility commands for testing and to run the game without problems with this command:
```py
pip install memory-profiler
``` 
Similarly, you must also install pygame and numpy.
To run the game with the memory profiler and afterwards view the plot of memory usage, use:
```sh
mprof run main.py
mprof plot
```

To run a benchmark of all heuristics against one another, run benchmark.py instead.

### To play the game
Run the following command:
```py
python3 main.py
```
or if the above doesn't work due to your python version:
```py
python main.py
``` 
or 
```py
py main.py
``` 
Ater running the terminal command you can choose running the game with graphical user interface or for testing purposes, without GUI, by writting to the terminal according to the instructions given after running the game.
